# SNDS: sums of non-descending sublists

> Given a list of numbers, return a list of the sums of each non-decreasing sublist.
> For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 5, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3]`,
> the output should be `[9, 12, 3, 6]`.

This Python module computes sums of all non-descending sublists from a given list of numerical values.
The module is used as a demo as part of a workshop for managing research software projects.
